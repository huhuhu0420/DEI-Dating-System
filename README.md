## Problem Statement

Traditional dating applications often fail to accommodate the diverse spectrum of sexual orientations and gender identities, leaving many users unable to find suitable matches or fully express their authentic selves. This lack of inclusivity creates a barrier to meaningful connections and equitable participation in online dating platforms.

There is a need for an **DEI Dating System** that offers a comprehensive and affirming experience, enabling individuals of all gender identities and sexual orientations to connect authentically while fostering a safe and supportive environment.

## Description
